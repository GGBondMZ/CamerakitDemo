-->

(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)

(Include your CameraKit setup and usage.)
<!--
  What happens if you skip this step?

  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,
  but itâ€™s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

  Please remember that:

    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
